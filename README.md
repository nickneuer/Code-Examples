 
These are some coding examples I've put together from a few exercises in Python and SQLite. Government_Queries.sql is a homework assignment from a friend's database managment class which queries a database populated by hw3populate.sql. 

Matrix_Ex.py is an example that a friend and I worked as a way to teach me more about classes and inheritance and expand upon Linear_Algebra_Classes.py
